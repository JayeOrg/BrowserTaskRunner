            Review this PR for both code quality and security. Check for:
            - Bugs, logic errors, and edge cases
            - Adherence to project conventions in AGENTS.md
            - Injection risks (command injection, path traversal)
            - Secrets or credentials in code
            - Unsafe deserialization or eval usage
            - WebSocket security issues
            - Vault/crypto implementation concerns
            Only flag security issues if they are real — no hypotheticals.
