            Review this PR for both code quality and security. Check for:
            - Bugs, logic errors, and edge cases
            - Adherence to project conventions in AGENTS.md
            - Injection risks (command injection, path traversal)
            - Secrets or credentials in code
            - Unsafe deserialization or eval usage
            - WebSocket security issues
            - Vault/crypto implementation concerns
            Only flag security issues if they are real — no hypotheticals.

  # Codex removed: overlaps with Claude's inline review. CodeRabbit covers the
  # second-opinion role with its structured walkthrough + path-aware instructions.
  # Keeping Claude for AGENTS.md convention enforcement + security analysis.
  # CodeRabbit (via .coderabbit.yaml) for walkthrough + path-scoped review.
