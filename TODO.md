Improvements:

- Review DX via agent
- Review all code manually and see how it feels to read

Tasks to add:

- Job site scrapers
- Resume site fillers
- Autofill for cover letters based on keyword search? See how far we can take automating applying for jobs

Musings:

- Look into spec driven development (probably create a new project for this)

Notes on claude.md
Personal one should just have personal quirks
Checked in one/skills should have team agreed standards and be updated with workarounds for problems as they come up
Don't need to overengineer it. Model improvements will probably make a bunch of it obselete in a few months.

Can automate PR reviews, security reviews, shepherding things to prod

Give a swarm a spec, tell it to use jira to split up the context of the spec, and let the swarm take tasks off of the board

If the task seems hard, use more sub agents to research.

Claude.md is just for stuff you repeatedly say
