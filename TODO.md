Notes on claude.md
Personal one should just have personal quirks
Checked in one/skills should have team agreed standards and be updated with workarounds for problems as they come up
Don't need to overengineer it. Model improvements will probably make a bunch of it obselete in a few months.

Recurring tasks:

- Review DX via agent
  - Overall
  - Through dev and customer personas
  -
- Review all code manually and see how it feels to read

- Review context use
  - memory
  - docs
  - skills
  - rules
  - readmes
  - agents.md
