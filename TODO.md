Extension based pause/rewind/play steps

It would be good to have a test option to replay steps on an existing browser session so I don't need to keep running through login and mfa.

Then we want to build various jobsite scraper tasks

Maybe include a nandos task that saves browser state so we don't need to re-log each time unless that's expired

Dry run
